RULES:
1. You and another player pick a category.
2. It can be from a pre-compiled list (hit the category button) or make a list yourselves.
3. The starting player needs to say an item from that category then click the corresponding, starting, letter.
4. That letter has now been 'used' and can't be said again until the round is over.
5. If you run out of time or say something with an already used letter, the opposing player gains a point.
6. First to 10 points wins!

Don't be afraid to make up your own rules either!
